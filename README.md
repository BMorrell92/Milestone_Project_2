# Listen & Chill! (Meditation Website) Listen & Chill! 

## Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-End Site 

* Listen & Chill is an interactive website with the purpose of providing a selection of ambient sounds to encourage meditation or provide a relaxing soudscape for the user to focus to. Listen and Chill allows the user to pick how long and what sound they would like to listen to. This website has a responsive and minimalist design, and provides a simple but effective experience to the user. 

* This is my Milestone Project 2 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website features one page and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Website Structure and Features

### Wireframes

[View my wireframes in PDF format here.](https://github.com/BMorrell92/Milestone_Project_2/blob/main/assets/wireframes/MS2%20Wireframe.pdf). It should be noted, that the wireframes do not exactly match the final product, however, it does capture the main structure.

### Typograhpy

All text is in Fuzzy Bubbles. This font is visually appealing and playful. Since the website has minimal text, it is the chosen font throughout.

### Website Architecture

The website consists of one simple page which intergrates all the interactive features. There are three sections where the user can provide input to achieve the desired output; the Time Selection, Play/Pause and Sound Selection sections. The content on the landing page has been styled using [Bootrap Jumbotron Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) to fill as much space as possible. 

- Time Selection:
