# Meditation Website ("Chill and Listen!")

## Milestone Project 2 - Interactive Front-End Site 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/fledgling-website-mockup.jpg"></h2>

* Chill and Listen is an interactive website with the purpose of providing a selection of ambient sounds to encourage meditation or provide a relaxing soudscape to the user. Listen and Chill allows the user to pick how long and what sound they would like to listen to. This website has a responsive and minimalist design, and provides a simple but effective experience to the user. 

* This is my Milestone Project 2 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website features one page and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It was found that on some devices the contact page was too short and the footer was not at the bottom of the page. This was fixed by adding bottom padding to the contact form. The website was found to be responsive on all devices.

### Manual Testing 

### Challenging User Stories 

















## Design

### Colour Scheme

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/colours.jpg"></h2>

- A simple colour scheme has been used. The website aesthetic mirrors that of a book; the background is plain white which allows the colour illustrations and dark typography to stand out. 

- The footer and nav bar share a background colour which is in keeping with the palette yet distinguishes these sections from the rest of the page. 

- I used the [Material Design Colour Tool](https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=0) to decide on colour choices. 

### Typography

- Headings are in Baskervville and normal text is in Verdana. Baskervvile is a refined serif font which adds personality to the website. Verdana is an easily readable sans-serif font frequently used for websites and applications. Fallback fonts of Serif and Sans-serif have been used for Headings and normal text respectively in case the fonts cannot be imported into the site correctly. 

- I chose to use Baskervville in lower case for the website title, on the landing page and in the footer, as I feel this softens the font and makes it more friendly. 

### Imagery and Aesthetics 

- Imagery is an important part of gameplay. I created a series of digital illustrations to be used in the game. They are all 550x550 pixels, and the content is approximately the same size and style, so they look coherent. I have used transitions so that the images fade in and out gently with the game content. This helps make the gameplay feel gentle and engaging, which the hand-drawn illustrations give the game a human touch. 

- I also created a GIF for the main landing page, which hints at the content of the game. All images were compressed before use on the website. 

### Icons 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/colour-icons.jpg"></h2>

- I used icons from Font Awesome as score indicators during each game round. They turn green or red depending on whether the user gets a question right or wrong.

# Features

## Landing Page Features

### Centered Landing Page Format with Buttons

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/landing-page.jpg"></h2>

- I decided to use a centered landing page format as I wanted this page to be clean and have a strong impact.  

- The landing page displays the website title ‘Fledgling’ and a compelling Call To Action; ‘hone your bird watching skills’. 

- For this reason, I have not also included a navigation bar on this page. Instead, there are large, eye-catching buttons to the two other website pages are present in the center of the page.  

### Footer (Same on all pages)

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/footer.jpg"></h2>

- The footer that appears on the Landing Page is the same as every other page on the website, which helps keep the website consistent.  

- The footer features the website title and also a description, to give the user a clearer sense of the purpose of the website; ‘An interactive website designed to engage people in birdwatching’. 

- The footer also features social media links and copyright information. 

## Game Page Features

### Nav Bar

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/nav-bar-game.jpg"></h2>

- The nav bar is the same colour as the footer, helping to frame the page and keep the website looking simple and consistent. The website title links back to the landing page. 

- When the user first loads the game, the How To Play button appears next to the Start Game button, so they can clearly see it before they start the game, especially when using a smaller device. 

- Once the user starts the game, the How To Play button moves into the top navigation, so they can access it during gameplay without loosing their progress. 

- On smaller device sizes, the Nav Bar becomes a drop-down menu, which makes it compact while it remains user friendly. I created this using Bootstrap. 

- *add sightings button?*

### How To Play Modal

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/game-modal.jpg"></h2>

- I decided to put the game instructions into a modal so that the user could access them anytime during gameplay without losing their progress. I created this using Bootstrap. 

- The information presented is concise and bullet-pointed for easy reading. There is a close button at the top and the bottom of the modal, so the user can exit easily on any device size. 

### Start Game Screen 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/game-page.jpg"></h2>

- This is the screen that loads when the game page is first loaded or refreshed. When the player clicks Start Game, then the game begins.  

- The purpose of the game is to correctly answer questions to identify the 5 birds outlined. 

### Select Bird Screen 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/select-bird-screen.jpg"></h2>

- This is the appearance of the page at the start of each round. 

- There are 5 rounds, 1 for each bird. To start a round, the user selects the bird they would like to identify and clicks “Select”. 

- The ‘selected’ bird is framed by a green border. 

- The Select button only becomes live when the user selects a bird. An error message will appear if they press the select button without selecting a bird. The user cannot select more than one bird at once. This means the user cannot break the game. 

- The user cannot select a bird they have already completed, which means the user must attempt every bird once before the game ends. 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/error-select-bird.jpg"></h2>

 ### Round Screen 

 <h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/question-view.jpg"></h2>

- There will be 4 turns in each round. During each turn, the image of the bird changes, and there is a multiple-choice question about the new image shown. 

-The questions run through features commonly used for bird identification, e.g. size, colour, habitat and other distinctive features. 

- For each turn, the user must select the answer they think best matches the image shown and click “Submit”. 

- The selected answer is framed by a dark black border. 

- If the user tries to click submit before they have selected an answer option, then there will be an alert. 

- After each turn, the success indicator icons will change colour, depending on whether they got the question right or wrong. 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/error-select-answer.jpg"></h2>

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/colour-icons.jpg"></h2>

### End of Round Screen 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/end-round-score.jpg"></h2>

- Once the user has completed the round, they will get shown their score the round, and the bird’s identity will be revealed. 

- Depending on how well they did, they will get a different feedback message. This suggests that if they did well that round, then they definitely saw that bird and congratulated on correctly identifing it. However, if they didn’t do well, then they ‘might’ have seen that bird and can’t be confident in their identification. This is like birdwatching in reality. 

- There is also a fun fact shared about the bird, to entertain and educate the user. 

- The user can then press ‘Continue’, and they will return to the Round screen to complete the next bird. The bird they have completed is now identified, and you can see the full illustration on the round screen. 

### End Of Game Screen 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/end-game-score-feedback.jpg"></h2>

- Once the user has completed the final round, all the birds will be identified and their overall score for the game will be shown. 

- Depending on how well they did, they will get a different message. If they did well, then they are congratulated. If they did not do well, then it is suggested they could play again and improve their score. 

- The user can then choose to play again to beat their score, or else move to the bird sightings page. 

## Sightings Page Features

### Nav Bar 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/nav-bar-sightings.jpg"></h2>

- The nav bar is consistent with that shown on the Game Screen. The website title links back to the landing page. 

- There is a Learn More button in the nav bar. This provides the user with more information on where the bird sightings data is from, and further birdwatching resources. 

- On smaller device sizes, the Nav Bar becomes a drop-down menu, which makes it compact while it remains user friendly. I created this using Bootstrap. 

### Learn More Modal 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/more-info-modal.jpg"></h2>

- I decided to put information about the sightings Data into a modal so that the user could access it anytime during their sightings searches without losing their current search. I created this using Bootstrap. 

- The information presented is concise and bullet-pointed for easy reading. There is a close button at the top and the bottom of the modal, so the user can exit easily on any device size. 

- It was important to me to clearly credit eBird, as they do important work which anyone can get involved with, and their API allowed me to pull bird sighting data into my website. I also thought it important to link to further birdwatching resources, e.g. the RSPB website, as this is a great resource to learn more about birdwatching beyond the scope of my project. 

### Page Title 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/sighting-screen.jpg"></h2>

- This makes it clear to the user what the search bar does. I originally imagined the user looking for sightings close to where they live. However, I wanted to keep it clear that you can look for sightings anywhere in the world (where the data is available). 

- The title also includes a link to eBird, which makes the credit obvious for users on smaller screen sizes, when the ‘Learn More’ button goes into the drop-down menu. 

### Local Bird Sightings List 

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/sightings-page-table.jpg"></h2>

- The user enters an address (street address, area, town, state or city), and selects a distance radius between 5 and 50 kilometers then presses Submit.  

- I use the Google Geocoding API to turn the address provided into coordinates. These are then passed into the eBird API, along with the selected distance radius, to provide a list of recent local bird sightings. 

- Bird Sighting data is returned, with the most recent sightings first. The data shown includes the bird name, the location observed, the number observed (where applicable) and the date/ time the observation was made. 

- I chose these columns as I felt they would be most relevant to the user. The columns nearest to the left I feel are the most important. By limiting the data to four columns and prioritising their order, it is easier to read and view on a smaller device size. 

- The location observed name is important as I believe this will resonate most with novice birdwatchers, who may not recognise the bird names, but may recognise the names of places close to them where birds have been observed. I truncated this to 30 characters, so most place names should fit, but the table will not be distorted by extremely long place names. 

- The search also returns the formatted address used in the search. This makes it clear to the user the address which is being used in the search. So, it is clear if they have incorrectly entered it. 

- There are errors if the API doesn't work, if the address enetered is not recognised, or if there are no results for the address enetered.

<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/error-if-not-proper-address-entered.jpg"></h2>
<h2 align="center"><img src="assets/readme/error-if-address-too-broad-or-no-results.jpg"></h2>

## Future Features

### Game Play  

- I would like to add an alert when a user is going to exit the page to inform them that they will lose their game progress. This would prevent them from accidentally exiting the page. If this was in place, then I could link the Sightings page  to the Game page nav bar. 

- I would like to explore ways to make the gameplay more accessible to visually impaired users. At present, as a picture game, it is not well-suited to those who rely on screen-readers. 

- If I were to develop the game further, I would add more birds. So the user could play mutliple time and play different birds each time. 

- I would explore ways to make the images load or cache more quickly. When a user first plays, they can experience some jumping of content (see unresolved bugs), especially if they’re on a slow internet connection. I explore ways to prevent this from happening. 

### Sightings 

- I would like to offer more filtering/ search options to the user. The eBird API allows more search parameters, e.g. you can search or filter results by bird name. So, I include more search options for the user, to return more specific results. 

- I feel the sightings page would benefit from visuals/ images. I would explore ways to make the page more visual, or make it easier for users to find images. For example, I could create a hyperlink from every bird name which would conduct and image search for that bird and open it in a new tab. 

- The tabular data isn’t as well presented on mobile as it is on desktop. I would use media queries to make the presentation more suitable to smaller screen sizes.  

- To further develop the project, I would use the Google Maps Javascript API rather than the Google Maps Geocoding Service. This would allow me to apply more restrictions to my API. (See resolved bugs)
